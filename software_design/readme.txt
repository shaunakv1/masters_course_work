Please use this repository wisely.

Check in frequently.

Do on check in binary files or files generated by the compiler or
tools.

Please do not delete files. Instead update them. If you delete
a file, there are two problem. 

1. svn does not really delete it internally, it is still there.

2. If you delete a file and recreate content with same file name
(instead of simply updating the file), you lose track of the change
history.

Do not name files with space in their names (for example use SomeFile
instead of Some File).

If you are not sure about something, please ask Venkat for help.

Go ahead, try your svn repository today!
