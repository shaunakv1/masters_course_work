HW1: Due 11:59PM Friday June 11.
Feel free to check in files as many times as you like until
the deadline. You can ask review of your code anytime.
Files outside the HW1 directory will not be used for grading.

Write a Robot class that will learn maneuvering and be ready
to exercise them. I have provided a sample code (in the form
of unit tests) that shows an example of how I may use your Robot
class.
