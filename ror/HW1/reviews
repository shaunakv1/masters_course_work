Unit tests I originally provided pass [2]:
Code quality [2]:
if something
  true
else
  false

should be written as

something
(you can get rid of the if and else)

Unit tests I have now provided pass [6]: -0.8
 [Each test carries .4 points]
The other 3 failures are due to ArgumentError vs. RuntimeError.

Floor of Total [10]: 9
