rails grads

ruby script/server (on windows use \)

open http://localhost:3000 (on windows use start instead of open)

ruby script/generate scaffold Degree title:string name:string years:integer

rake --tasks

rake db:migrate

cd db
sqlite3 development.sqlite3
    .tables
    pragma table_info(degrees);
    select * from degrees;

We examined the code generated so far

We create a degree, and edited it
Then we created a degree with no name or title
That is ugly, we will fix it using
validate.

But, before then, let's reset the database
rake db:migrate:redo

In the degree.rb, added the second line below:
class Degree < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of :name, :title, :years
end

Now to validate the years range, we add to degree.rb
validates_inclusion_of :years, :in => [2, 4, 6]


ruby script/generate scaffold Graduate first_name:string last_name:string year_of_graduation:integer degree_id:integer

rake db:migrate

I want degree to appear as list box.

Fire up 
ruby script/console
Try code like
Degree.all.map { |d| [d.name, d.id] }

Edit new.html.erb (in gradutes view)
change
<p>
  <%= f.label :degree_id %><br />
  <%= f.text_field :degree_id %>
</p>
to
<p>
  <%= f.label :degree_id %><br />
  <%= f.select :degree_id, Degree.all.map { |d| [d.name, d.id] } %>
</p>

To fix the index view,
in graduate.rb, add
belongs_to :degree
and change index.html.erb to
use graduate.degree.name instead of
gradute.degree_id.

class Graduate < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :degree
  
  validates_presence_of :first_name, :last_name, :year_of_graduation, :degree
  validates_inclusion_of :year_of_graduation, :in => 1927..4000
end
