We populated degrees and graduates with some data.

In console, we tried pluralize on
"person".pluralize
"GrauateAdvisor".pluralize

Created under controllers directory
graduate_advisors_controller.rb with
class GraduateAdvisorsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    puts params[:year] 
  end
end



try
http://localhost:3000/graudate_advisors

Have a routing problem.
Fix routes.rb to add
map.resources :graduate_advisors

mkdir graduate_advisors under views
Create index.html.erb under graduate_advisors
with

This will display students who
graduate in a particular year.
(we will change this soon).

Renamed action to disp and view file to
disp.html.erb (from index.html.erb).


map.root :controller => 'graduates', :action => 'index'  
and also moved index.html to index.html.old

map.connect 'graduate.html', :controller => 'graduates', :action => 'index'  

map.connect 'disp/:year', :controller => 'graduate_advisors', :action => 'disp', :requirements => { :year => /\d{4}/}  

Now these two will behave different:
open http://localhost:3000/disp/2009
open http://localhost:3000/disp/haha

You can also specify defaults if you like:
..., :defaults => { :year => 2010 }


map.basic 'freebie', :controller => 'graduates', :action => 'index'
map.basic 'paid', :controller => 'graduate_advisors', :action => 'disp', :year => 2009

Url can route different category of people to different locations.
