FileWriterTest:
Remove getContents() method from fileWriter. 
When I said in the earlier review
"Remove getWrittenString. This is not the responsibility of 
FileWriter." if you rename that method instead of removing,
the problem does not go away. You need to pay attention
to review comments and follow. Otherwise, you are wasting
your time and mine.

FileWriter:
filePath = ".\\build\\" + fileName; 
This is a bad idea. 
In the previous review I said "By asking your test to create the file"
so, your test should give this path, not your FileWriter. Why should
your FileWriter depend on the build directory? Does that make sense?

Also, don't use \\. Java is platform neural. Use forward slash instead
of \\.

Once you address the above, you will notice there is a lot common
between StringWriter and FileWriter. Create an abstract class or
interface that is common to the two. You will also notice
there is a lot common between StringWriterTest and FileWriterTest.
Create an abstract class WriterTest that has common code from the
two.

Ask for review if you get stuck at this step.

Run ant, then run ant clean. Notice how it leaves behind
testfile.txt. By asking your test to create the file within the
build directory, you can have this cleaned up when clean is run.

StringWriterTest:
protected void setUp() throws Exception
to
protected void setUp()

StringWriter:
Remove closed() method. You don't need it.

FileWriterTest:

Write a test that deals with a pre-existing file.

FileWriter:
private File file; remove

Make fields private.

Don't suppress exceptions. Propagate them up the chain.

You already have a BufferedWriter created in the constructor.
In write, simply use it, why are you creating another one?

Remove getWrittenString. This is not the responsibility of 
FileWriter.

Remove public boolean closed()

In close, you need to close the BufferedWriter.

Remove Writer empty directory within the Writer directory.

StringWriterTest:

Remove blank lines in the beginning or end of method body within each 
method.

Add a blank line between each method.

StringWriter:
Remove constructor, initialize field in place instead.

Remove isClosed() method.

Proceed to writing test and code for FileWriter.

Remove buildGrading.xml. Only provide build.xml.

Rename testIfStringWriterCreatesABlankStringInitially to
testCreateStringWriter.

Rename testIfStringWriterWritesAStringAsExpected
to testWrite

stringWriter.write("Class testing 123");
Make this simple, why not just stringWriter.write("test 1");
Less noise.

Rename testContentsBeforeAndAfterClosing to
testWriteBeforeClose (that is what you are doing).
Remove String expected=stringWriter.getWrittenString();

Rename testCloseAndWrite testWriteAfterClose
Remove String expected="test";

StringWriter:
Change
boolean closed = false;
to
boolean closed;

Make writtenString a StringBuilder instead of String.

In write, simply use closed instead of isClosed().

Remove isClosed method.

Nice to see you have provided build.xml!

Specifically I mentioned no main. Remove TestCode.

You have taken a big leap before asking for the first review.
Not a good idea. I specifically asked you to ask for review
after a small step.

StringWriterTest

writer.write("test", null);  Why two parameters?

What is AOperator? Get rid of Operator, AOperator, etc.
Only send me test for StringWriter and StringWriter class for review.
