added LoginController
and login.html.erb
and modifed routes.rb
with map.connect for login/login

In Graduates controller we added
before_filter :check_user_logged_in

def check_user_logged_in
  puts "****** checking if you logged in"
  redirect_to :controller => 'login', :action => 'login' if session[:user] == nil
end


After you visit graduates, you will realize you need to protect other controller, but not by making your code wet. So to keep it dry, move the above
to ApplicationController.

But that puts in a spin, always asking you to go to login, even when you go to login.

before_filter :check_user_logged_in, :except => [:login, :logout]


commenting out the filter so we can move on
to talk about function testing separately.
