Assignment 3 Due 11:59PM Monday June 28th

In Assignment 2 you wrote a console application. You will create a 
Rails application for the same here (you are not required to copy or
reuse code from that assignment. Feel free to create fresh code here).

Your code should have the following:

Good unit and functional tests.
High coverage
User should be able to view books when they visit your application url
(without providing any controller name - so simply visiting http://localhost:3000
should show books list).
User should be able to click on the link to publisher to view the publisher information.
User should be able to click on author name to view all books created by that author.
In other words, make it intuitive for the user to use your application.
