Check the coverage.

Some initial run through the features look good.

Nice to see tests pass (and there are quite a few of those you have).
Fairly good coverage, but take a look at one or two that have lesser
than desired coverage.

On launching the browser, I see a search. But no matter what I entered
there, and clicked on search, nothing happened. Do I have to login before
using search. If so, then search should not be here. If not, a better
response than being quite to search request is needed.

Once I register, it would be nice to see something like, "Your account was
created successfully, please login now." instead of "User was successfully created."

Title must contain only alphabets is not a good idea. What if I want to give away
a IDE with a particular version number on it (like IDEA 9.1).

"Post was successfully created" needs to be something better. Why not instead
take me to home page where you show the most recent posted item on the top or
highlighted... That would be better, isn't it.

No, you don't want to display the password in the Account Information page!

History page displays funny object details!

Very nice work, the above are suggestions to improve, but I really like what
you have done so far.

Some initial comments. Remove the development database
from the repository. Ensure rake test runs successfully (it is not
right now).
