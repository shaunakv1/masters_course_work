HW2. Due by 11:59PM on Friday June 18
Write a test class that will dynamically create test methods
for data given in testdata.dat. The file testdata.dat
has a few rows of test data. Each row has a year and
a true if the year is leap, false otherwise (note:
there is an error in the test data, it incorrectly states that
year 2000 is not a leap year when it isâ€”this is intentional).

The code you write here has the following requirements:
Do not use send.
Do not manually write one test per test data, you need to synthesize tests 
instead.
The tests you synthesize must indicate failure by their name, for
example, when test for year 2000 fails, the error will look as shown below:
=begin
Loaded suite C:/workarea/leap_year_test
Started
...F......
Finished in 0.016 seconds.

  1) Failure:
test_is_leap_2000(LeapYearTest) [C:/workarea/leap_year_test.rb:30]:
<false> expected but was
<true>.

10 tests, 10 assertions, 1 failures, 0 errors
=end

keep the test file and the lear_year.rb in the same directory for this Homework.
