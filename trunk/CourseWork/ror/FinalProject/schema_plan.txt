1. User (id, Name, Email, Password)
2. Post (id, Title, Description, Tags , user_id, dibber , exchanged)
3. Message(id, Subject, body , sender_id , user_id , read)
4. History (id, Title, Description , user_id, action = posted/received)

Relationships:

User - one to many - Post
User - one to many - Message
User - one to many - History

-- Line of thinking--
1. No relationship between history and post because, irrispective of a post now exists in system or not, its history should exist in a users account
2. Messages are related only to receiver and not sender, because after sending a message, sender has not right over it, the message belongs to receiver.
3. Post will belong to creator and dibber is just the user_id of user who has placed a dib for it
