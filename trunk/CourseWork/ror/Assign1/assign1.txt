Yahoo weather provides a way to find the temperature of various cities.
Write a Ruby program that will read a given data file with woeids (a sample
file is given), go out to Yahoo, and extract the temperature for each city. 
Your program will then display (in alphabetical order of city/state) the city 
name, state symbol, and the temperature value.

The URL for Yahoo Weather service is

http://weather.yahooapis.com/forecastrss?w=WOEID&u=f

Replace the WOEID in the URL with the actual woeid value.
