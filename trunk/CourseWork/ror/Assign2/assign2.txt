Assignment 2 Due 11:59PM Monday June 21st

Write a console application to manage a personal library. The application 
will maintain a list of books. Each book has a title, a publisher, and
a list of authors. The operations allowed are:

1. Create, delete, update a publisher. A publisher only has a name and an id.
2. Create, delete, update an author. An author has only a first name and a last name.
3. Create, delete, update a book. A book has a title, a publisher, and
one or more authors.
4. List all the books in alphabetical order of title.
5. Search for a book given an author's last name.
6. Search for a book given part of the title.
7. You can only delete an author or a publisher if no book is associated 
with them.

Build you application so it interactively allows a user to view books.

You will use Ruby with Active Record (no rails).
